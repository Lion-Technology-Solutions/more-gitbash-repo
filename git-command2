Today is Sunday November 6th 2022 and I have the following advancement

TO START A GIT PROJECT
Mkdir 

Type Git init to change it to git folder

git status to confirm a git directory done


create a git file in the new folder

Type touch and the name of the file you want

then type Git status to check

Type Git add to make the file trackable in git form-so we now have "GIT FOLDER
"GIT FILE" in the folder. when file is added it becomes git trackable and ready to commit, 

Then press "vi and the name of the file" if you want to type into the new file

Press "i" to starting typing and press "esc" key to leave

Then continue with git add and create git repository and get ready to push to the remote repo and get reviewer after pull request.


Thank you God for this understanding
